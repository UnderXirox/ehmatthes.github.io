title: Chopping wood makes me a better programmer
---

I recently bought a house that has a wood stove. The house is a fixer-upper, but the wood stove works wonderfully. It's the only thing that kept us warm the first two weeks after we moved in, when an electrical issue put our heat pump out of commission for a bit.

Chopping wood is a great respite from programming. It simplifies my world into one simple goal: chop this single piece of wood into two pieces. No matter how difficult and abstract my programming work has been, I get a moment where just one single, concrete thing matters.

I recently shared some Python cheat sheets I'd been working on. I suffer from impostor syndrome as much as anyone else, so I was nervous to share my work. The post started to get positive feedback, but I know enough not to get sucked into minute-by-minute refreshes. Heading outside to split a few rounds was a perfect break. There's something satisfying about doing something that so immediately benefits my family as well. I write this sitting amidst the sweet smell of freshly split spruce and hemlock, and I wonder if one of these pieces will keep us warm next Christmas morning.

I like chopping easy rounds that split with one swimg, and I like working on knotted rounds that take ten or fifteen swings to start splitting. It's like a puzzle - there's no crack to guide placement of the splitting edge, so I just pick an angle and start swinging. If no cracks develop, I reposition the round and try from another angle. Finally a small crack appears, and usually the round gives way in the next few swings. It's pretty satisfying to take ten swings that do nothing and then split the entire round in one final swing, with fresh sap filling the air around me. It's just like working persistently away at a seemingly intractable bug, and then it becomes perfectly clear how to fix your project.

I could go on about the art of splitting wood, and the joy of developing muscle memory in learning to place the splitting edge ever more precisely. About learning to read the wood better and better, knowing which species will split in which ways. About the connection with thousands of years of people keeping their homes warm by burning wood. About the larger process of going to the woods and cutting up fallen trees on a quiet morning, then bringing the rounds back home. But if you've got any purely non-technical, outdoors-focused pursuits you probably know the feeling.

Happy splitting, and happy programming!
